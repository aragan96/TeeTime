Welcome to Tee Time!

SETUP:

Download the APK onto your Android device. Install the APK using any APK installer.
Open the app; you may have to hit the "setup" button in the top right of the app for the correct screen width to register.

HOW TO PLAY:

First, select the ball you would like to play with by aiming your
head at one of the options and pulling the trigger.

Then, pull the trigger on your ball to start!

Once in the game, move your head to direct the red line in front of the ball.
The length of the red line, which oscillates, indicates the power that you will hit the ball with.
Pull the trigger to hit the ball in the direction indicated by the red line.

If you need to get a better angle, select the left or right arrow 
and pull the trigger to move 45 degrees in the corresponding
direction around the ball.

By clicking the MENU button on the top of the screen, you can restart the level, change the 
difficulty (which changes the pars of the levels), or change the color of the ball as you play!

Try to get the ball in the hole in the fewest number of swings!

Have fun!

All assets were standard assets from Unity and the Google Cardboard SDK.

NOTE: I modified the GvrReticle script from the Cardboard SDK slightly to set a boolean to indicate if I was in 'select mode.'
There may have been a different way to do this, this was just the first method I tried and it worked.

The following tutorial was used for selecting items with Google Cardboard:
